# Data-Minning-projects
In this project we are going to do several things with our data in two parts:
## Part1:
- missing handling
- Remove noise
- Remove duplicate records
- Remove irrelevant attributes
- Remove correlated attributes
. Correlation rate greater than or equal 0.8 for positive correlation
. Correlation rate less than or equal -0.8 for negative correlation
-Apply discretization on numeric attributes as possible
## Part 2:
1. Split your dataset into training and testing sets 80% and 20% for
training and testing sets respectively and save each of these sets into
separated files.
2. Muse the following classifiers :
▪ KNN
▪ Decision Tree
▪ Naïve Bayes
3. Depend on your previous study on clustering technique (K means)
use this technique on a suitable dataset.
